# LumberJack Cheat

Let the bot play lumberjack for you.

(tested only on Linux)

### Requirements

**I recommend you install these packages insite a [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)**

If you have PIP, just type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you don't, I recommend you to.

### How to ~~play~~ WIN!

Open the LumberJack game in a browser via Telegram on your Desktop.

Use some tool to find out some Coordinates on the screen, like the Play Button
and some branches. Open `play.py` in a text editor and read the first 20 lines,
and you'll get more details how to set these settings.

Make sure you can see at least the Play Button on your screen before run the
script (reduce the size of you terminal if necessary).

Type `python play.py` and watch.
